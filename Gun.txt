Turret has an angle and a desired angle. Turret also has entered angle

Turret always turns to reach the desired angle.

The desired angle changes to the entered angle when "Calibrate" is pressed

desired angle changes relatively after each shot due to recoil

Space bar fires a shot if the gun is stationary (angle = desired angle). Otherwise error is sent

Ships spawn and move towards center:

Any no gun ships simply try to collide with the turret

Jet (1 hp):
	Chooses a radius around the turret and boats to it. Then proceeds to pick points on circle with that radius and move between them in straight lines while stopping to fire
	
Medium Ship (2 hp):
	- Spawns copters which can be shot down. Copters fly directly at turret and explode on contact.
	- Ship moves slowly to target before selecting a radius and circling the turrent while firing at it
	
Large ship (3 hp):
	- Select random points on map and move to them while stopping every now and then to fire at turret
