CHANGELOG:
-------------=
v(large_release).(small_fix)
-------------=
v.1.0:
    - Added Tutorial Menu
    - Added 'Jetboat Charger' enemy
    - Added 'Cruiser Charger' enemy
    - Added 'Mothership Charger' enemy

v.0.2:
    - Fixed resizing bugs from previous version
    - Set the minimal radius input to 75
    - Fixed ocean graph labels from 900 to 450

v.0.1:
    - Added Turret object which can be rotated via angle and radius inputs
    - Added Turret Laser
    - Added Explosion animation
    - Added Shooting ability and recoil
    BUGS:
        - 0 radius causes explosion at origin and not at turret tip
        - Resizing screen changes the radius distance for the shot
        - Resizing the screen does not change the laser thickness

PLANNED FEATURES:
--------------=
    - Add Chat log to display various information such as error messages or kill feeds
    - Add shooting variants of each current enemy with unique AIs
    - Add path prediction for enemies so that enemies can prevent colliding (Use alternate thread
      to calculate the current path forecast for each ship. Any predicted collisions will be resolved
      by lowering the speed of one of the ships)
    - Add collision detection between enemy ships and add explosions on collision which deal 1 damage to each of
      the collided ships
    - Add Turret missiles which will follow the path of a parametric equation given by the user (Use another thread
      to calculate the per pixel path of the ship which will store every pixel point on the path)
    - Add missile lifespan as a way for the user to prevent the missile from crashing back into turret if the equation
      causes the curve to return to origin
    - Add waves to the ocean /\/\/\ O_o
    - Add Pausing ability
    - Add local high score saving and a leader board with dates of each of the top 10 scores achieved



==========================
AI Descriptions for ships:

Jet (1 hp):
	Chooses a radius around the turret and boats to it. Then proceeds to pick points on circle with that radius and move between them in straight lines while stopping to fire
	
Medium Ship (2 hp):
	- Spawns copters which can be shot down. Copters fly directly at turret and explode on contact.
	- Ship moves slowly to target before selecting a radius and circling the turrent while firing at it
	
Large ship (3 hp):
	- Select random points on map and move to them while stopping every now and then to fire at turret
